# Mock version of `haskell-lmdb` (non-funcional)

This is a non-functioning version of `haskell-lmdb` to use as “drop-in replacement” for the normal one in cases were it is not necessary. In particular, the motivation for it is to use it as a replacement when compiling to `wasm`.

For a working version please use: https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-lmdb
